## [2026-02-17 10:24] - Phase 0/1 Scaffold Committed

- Context:
  - Initialized repository from AGENTS.md requirements.
  - Targeted Phase 0 (OpenClaw control-plane) and Phase 1 (engine hygiene baseline).
- Changes:
  - Created npm workspace monorepo scaffolding, strict TS toolchain, lint/test/format scripts.
  - Added Husky + lint-staged pre-commit flow.
  - Bootstrapped `apps/engine` with zod env parsing, redacting logger integration, WAL SQLite, migrations, ops server, and heartbeat.
  - Added OpenClaw assets: `openclaw/openclaw.json.example`, skill stub, and minimal plugin command bridge.
  - Added tests for env validation, DB pragmas, and ops auth.
  - Added/updated docs in `docs/` for architecture/runbook/threat-model tracking.
- Validation:
  - `npm run typecheck` passed.
  - `npm run test` passed.
  - `npm run lint` passed.
  - `npm run build` passed.
- Risks / Notes:
  - Node runtime in build environment was v20 while baseline targets Node 22 (engine warning only; no block).
  - Trading loop and market adapters are intentionally not implemented yet.
- Next:
  - Begin Phase 2 adapter interfaces and schema-first LLM output validation.

## [2026-02-17 10:30] - Root Tracking Docs Added

- Context:
  - Needed a GitHub-facing overview and session-level tracking files at repo root.
- Changes:
  - Added root `README.md` with architecture, API, env model, setup, quality gates, and roadmap.
  - Added root `LOG.md` (this file) and root `TODO.md` for cross-session handoff.
- Validation:
  - Documentation-only change; no runtime code modified.
- Risks / Notes:
  - Keep root `LOG.md`/`TODO.md` synchronized with `docs/LOG.md`/`docs/TODO.md` to avoid drift.
- Next:
  - Use root `TODO.md` as queue of record for upcoming sessions.

## [2026-02-17 10:44] - Applied Audit Recommendations (Security + Docs Sync)

- Context:
  - Reviewed `AUDIT.md` generated by Gemini agent and triaged actionable items.
- Changes:
  - Added `helmet` middleware to engine ops API (`apps/engine/src/ops/server.ts`).
  - Added configurable bind host `OPS_HOST` with default `127.0.0.1` (`apps/engine/src/config/env.ts`).
  - Updated server startup to bind with `OPS_HOST` and log host/port.
  - Added Docker override `OPS_HOST=0.0.0.0` for containerized access (`docker-compose.yml`).
  - Extended tests to assert security header presence from `helmet`.
  - Synced roadmap/process docs to reduce TODO drift between root and `docs/`.
- Validation:
  - `npm install` completed with added `helmet` dependency.
  - `npm run typecheck` passed.
  - `npm run test` passed.
  - `npm run lint` passed.
- Risks / Notes:
  - If `OPS_HOST=127.0.0.1` is used in Docker, host port mapping will not be reachable.
  - Keep root `TODO.md` as source of truth and mirror core phase changes to `docs/TODO.md`.
- Next:
  - Continue Phase 2 adapter work with schema-first LLM validation.
